# RAG_With_PDF-FullStack

Experimenting with Langchain, DataStax and Streamlit to build Full Stack app that allows users to directly chat with PDFs. Currently using open source models which are hosted locally

<h2> Future Work</h2>

1. Adding more models that are availble (including non open source models)
2. Optimizing latency between query and output
3. Hosting website on the cloud
